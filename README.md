        My first project I ever created getting into web development <br>I used this project to explore the use of Python in Web Development and using Flask to build a little web server.
        <br>
        Tech I used to build this:
        <h6>
                <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> 
                <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/">Flask</a> 
                <a href="http://mashup-template.com/">Mashup Template </a>
                <br>
            Hosted with <a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/">PythonAnywhere</a> <br>

Created the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files, using a template from 'Mashup', but obviously modified the template.

Created a server that contains a CSV file that will be saved on this machine.

Moved/Deployed from my machine to PythonAnywhere that has a dedicated server/server space to host my files.
