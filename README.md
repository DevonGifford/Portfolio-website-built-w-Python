### Notes

Created the HTML, CSS and JavaScript files, using a template from 'Mashup', but obviously modified the template.

Created a server that contains a CSV file that will be saved on this machine.

Moved/Deployed from my machine to PythonAnywhere that has a dedicated server/server space to host my files.
